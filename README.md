## VII Scientific Congress of Researchers in Training - University of Córdoba

Last 6th and 7th of February, the University of Córdoba held the 7th Scientific Congress of Researchers in Training. As participant and organizer it was a bit tough but we had a lot of fun. I had to present the advances of my thesis in a poster which, although it did not win in its category, I feel very proud of it and it cost me a lot of work, you know, programming in LaTeX is not so easy. In any case, I post the code and template for all those who want to adapt it to their future presentations.
